## Good Graph

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("GoodGraph.png")

```

-   Concentrations of extracted Fe in organic or mineral horizon soils from different oxides, magnetite, and organic-bound Fe.

-   Asterisks denote significant differences between organic and mineral horizons.

-   Color blind friendly colors, clear x and y-axis labels, error bars, ect.

## Bad Graph

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("BadGraph.png")

```

-   Trying to convey how many Nobel Laureates from each country + the total in each subject.

-   Difficult to compare (use the width of bands to estimate totals in each subject?)

-   May be exceptionally confusing for those who are color blind.
