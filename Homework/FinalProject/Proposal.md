## Final Project Proposal

### Who is in your group (or is it a solo project)?

Kathleen an I are in a group.

### Is your project an analysis or a tool?

Our project is going to be a tool (package).

### In a couple of sentences: What problem are you trying to solve, and who will it help? (No need to overthink “who will it help” - in the case of an analysis project, “It will make my dissertation better” is sufficient).

Our data is 15 .csv files of numerous types of environmental sensor data
from the SPRUCE project at ORNL. Currently, the names are indescriptive.
Our package will help improve readability for future data users by
including functions that will rename colums to a more useful naming
scheme. The package will contain functions that will easily, read,
check, plot, and export the data. We also hope to include sensor
documentation to help future users more easily troubleshoot error
readings.
